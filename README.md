# Regression-and-its-types
Types of Regression in Machine Learning
1. Linear Regression
Predicts a target variable using a straight line based on a linear relationship between input and output.

2.Polynomial Regression
Extends linear regression by adding polynomial terms, allowing it to model non-linear relationships.

3.Stepwise Regression
Iteratively adds or removes features based on statistical criteria to improve model performance.

4.Decision Tree Regression
Splits data into regions using decision rules, predicting the mean output for each region.

5.Random Forest Regression
An ensemble of decision trees that improves accuracy by averaging predictions from multiple trees.

6.Support Vector Regression (SVR)
Uses the principles of Support Vector Machines to fit the best line within a margin of tolerance.

7.Ridge Regression
A linear model with L2 regularization to reduce overfitting by shrinking coefficients.

8.ElasticNet Regression
Combines L1 and L2 regularization for a balance between Ridge and Lasso.
